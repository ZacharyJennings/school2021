* I am approaching the end of the first year of my PhD in astrophysics. I only started to teach 
  my self python in order to carry out astrophysical research. However, after this school, I feel 
  an obsession growing for coding itself. I look forward to being able to contribute to great 
  projects. Im also keen to start writing elegant scripts in Julia with the advantages of 
  subscripting, using sybomls etc... Thank you to everyone who delivered this school! 
  - Zachary Jennings.
